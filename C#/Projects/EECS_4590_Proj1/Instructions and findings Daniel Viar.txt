To run this project, please open the .sln in Visual Studio 2022.

This project uses a Dictionary from C# Collections.Generic and a Trie I made myself.

To use the trie, put -t in the arguements.
To use the Dictionary, put -d in the arguments

Right Click on the EECS_4590_Proj1 in the solution explorer and select properties.
	Go To Debug, then open debug launch profiles UI. Enter in the command line parameters in the respective box.

	The command line parameters should be in the format: Path to the directory where the files are stored and which setting you are using in either order
	Example: "C:\Users\dxvia\Desktop\Test Files" -t`or -h "C:\Users\dxvia\Desktop\Test Files"

Findings:
	I used the Stopwatch library in C# to time how long the reading and entering the entire directory into the data structures took. The Dictionary performed better than the trie by about .14 seconds consistently. I expect this is because of
the increased time it takes to go through each node every time on the trie, O(N) everytime, whereas the Dictionary, while a List(Dynamic Array), had insertions of O(1) unless a resize was needed due to optimizations in the data structure.
